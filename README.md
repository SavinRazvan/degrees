# Degrees

Created a social network analysis tool to determine the degrees of separation between actors using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The program processes data from IMDb, computes the shortest path of connections through shared movie roles, and outputs the sequence of movies that connect any two actors.

### Objective

Write a program that computes the shortest path between any two actors by identifying the sequence of movies that connects them.

### Data

The project uses datasets based on IMDb, containing information about actors, movies, and the relationships between them. These datasets include `people.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `stars.csv`, which provide the necessary details to compute the degrees of separation.
