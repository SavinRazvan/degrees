# Degrees

This project involves writing a program to determine the "degrees of separation" between two actors based on the movies they have starred in, inspired by the concept of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game.

### Objective

Write a program that computes the shortest path between any two actors by identifying the sequence of movies that connects them.

### Data

The project uses datasets based on IMDb, containing information about actors, movies, and the relationships between them. These datasets include `people.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `stars.csv`, which provide the necessary details to compute the degrees of separation.
